# Replace Conditional with Polymorphism

Identify switch statements or if-else chains based on object type - these are prime candidates for polymorphic replacement. Create class hierarchies where each type handles its own behavior. Focus on the Open/Closed Principle - new types should be addable without modifying existing conditionals. This refactoring transforms procedural code into proper object-oriented design.
