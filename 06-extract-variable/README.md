# Extract Variable

Break down complex expressions into intermediate variables with meaningful names. This makes code self-documenting and easier to debug. Focus on expressions that are hard to understand at first glance - complex calculations, chained method calls, or boolean conditions. Use this refactoring liberally - modern compilers optimize away extra variables.
