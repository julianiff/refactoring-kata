# Extract Method

Look for code fragments that can be grouped together - comments often indicate extraction opportunities. Focus on identifying the right granularity: methods should do one thing well with descriptive names. Pay attention to variable dependencies when extracting - parameters for inputs, return values for outputs. Master this fundamental technique first - it's the gateway to all other refactorings.
