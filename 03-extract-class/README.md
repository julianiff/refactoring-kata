# Extract Class

Identify clusters of data and methods that collaborate closely - these natural groupings indicate potential new classes. Look for fields always used together or method groups accessing specific fields. Common patterns include extracting address info from Person, separating business logic from persistence. Good extractions reveal hidden domain concepts and make classes easier to understand.
